# A TODO list of things I want to implement

- [ ] Creation/modification/saving of templates
  - [ ] Ask for permission to use localStorage to store user templates before doing it (https://svelte.dev/examples/modal)
- [ ] Import/export of templates (json)
- [ ] Other export formats than markdown (html, pdf, etc.)
